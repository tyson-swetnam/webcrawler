This research has produced the following data files:

### 1. Complete R1 Dataset (JSON)
**File:** `/home/tswetnam/github/webcrawler/crawler/config/r1_universities.json`

Contains all 187 R1 universities with:
- Official institution names and abbreviations
- Location data (city, state, region)
- Classification metadata (public/private, Carnegie designation)
- Primary domains and news source URLs
- Auto-generated AI news tag URLs
- Data quality indicators

**Status:** Auto-generated URLs require manual verification

## Next Steps for News Crawler Configuration

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Manual URL Verification** (Priority: High)
   - Verify news site URLs for all 187 institutions
   - Confirm AI topic/tag page existence and correct URLs
   - Identify RSS feed availability
   - Document any special crawling requirements

2. **Tier Prioritization** (Priority: Medium)
   - Classify institutions by AI research prominence
   - Assign crawl priority scores (1-200)
   - Determine optimal crawl frequency per institution

3. **Configuration Enhancement** (Priority: Medium)
   - Add institution-specific crawl delays
   - Configure RSS feed preferences where available
   - Document robots.txt restrictions
   - Add custom extraction rules for non-standard sites

4. **Data Quality Assurance** (Priority: High)
   - Test crawler against top 20 institutions
   - Validate content extraction accuracy
   - Verify deduplication effectiveness
   - Confirm AI relevance classification

### Recommended Verification Workflow:

```bash
# Sample institutions to verify first (by tier):
# Tier 1 (Elite AI Research): 15 institutions already verified
# Tier 2 (Major AI Centers): ~30 institutions - verify next
# Tier 3 (Growing AI Programs): ~50 institutions
# Tier 4 (Emerging R1 Programs): ~92 institutions
```
